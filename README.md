This project is aimed at distinguishing between blurred and sharp images using TensorFlow libraries, specifically implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The model architecture utilized here is DenseNet. We incorporated the Python Imaging Library (PIL) from the image library to handle image processing tasks efficiently.

Key Components:
TensorFlow Libraries: Leveraged for deep learning model development and training.
CNN Algorithm: Implemented for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
DenseNet Model: Chosen for its robust performance in feature extraction and classification.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Employed for image manipulation and processing tasks.
Data Augmentation: Techniques used to artificially expand the dataset for improved model generalization and performance.

This project serves as a practical application of deep learning techniques for image classification, with a focus on distinguishing between clear and blurred images.
